# Arkham horror chaos tokens

This application is made by a board game fan of the Arkham Horror series. The aim is to have a fun tool which can visualize the risks which every player has to evaluate multiple times during the gameplay.

The project also serves as a hobby project for learning about Svelte, SvelteKit, Tailwind and SkeletonLabs.
